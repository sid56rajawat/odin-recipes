    <p>Cool and refreshing, the mojito is a favorite summer cocktail. While it typically includes a shot of rum, the mojito mocktail proves that alcohol is not necessary. This mocktail offers the same mint-lime flavor, it's just as easy to mix up, and everyone can enjoy its fresh taste. The family-friendly beverage is a great addition to showers and parties, and a fantastic way to cool down on a hot summer day in the backyard.</p>
